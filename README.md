## Objective

Make a simple restaurant page.

1. The main page should include an image, headline, and some copy.
2. Use separate modules with content for different tabs. Each module should export a function that creates a div element, adds the appropriate content and styles to that element and then appends it to the DOM.
3. User should be able to switch between the tabs.
